Beat the Heat is a computer science senior design project that uses machine learning to predict fire incidents based on sattelite data and past fire records. This is an accompanying repository to the main repo https://github.com/KayleePham/Beat-the-Heat--Machine-Learning, where one can find all of the code related to machine learning and various aspects of the project not related to preprocessing the datasets. 

The purpose of this repo is to include all that's needed to process our datasets including the geotiff images. Some features in this repo that you won't find in the origional are methods that break down geotiff images of California into counties before processing, which was done in hopes to increase accuracy of ML models. Counties were selected over finer spatial resolution areas such as per 500m/1km grid cells because in the final dataset, the data are being classified into fire or no fire categories of which the past CA fire incident record has the smallest spatial resolution of fires by county.

The senior design project is for California State University Northridge (CSUN). Group members include: Kaylee Pham, David Shin, Saulo Rubio, Tyler Poplawski, Sergio Ramirez, and David Macoto Ward.
